You're a smart developer. You probably use [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) to abstract away access to
`URLSession` and all those nasty details you don't really care about. But then,
like lots of smart developers, you write ad hoc network abstraction layers. They
are probably called "APIManager" or "NetworkModel", and they always end in tears.

![Moya Overview](web/diagram.png)

Ad hoc network layers are common in iOS apps. They're bad for a few reasons:

- Makes it hard to write new apps ("where do I begin?")
- Makes it hard to maintain existing apps ("oh my god, this mess...")
- Makes it hard to write unit tests ("how do I do this again?")

So the basic idea of Moya is that we want some network abstraction layer that
sufficiently encapsulates actually calling Alamofire directly. It should be simple
enough that common things are easy, but comprehensive enough that complicated things
are also easy.

> If you use Alamofire to abstract away `URLSession`, why not use something
to abstract away the nitty gritty of URLs, parameters, etc?

Some awesome features of Moya:

- Compile-time checking for correct API endpoint accesses.
- Lets you define a clear usage of different endpoints with associated enum values.
- Treats test stubs as first-class citizens so unit testing is super-easy.

Sample Project
--------------

There's a sample project in the Demo directory. To use it, run `pod install` to download the required libraries. Have fun!

Project Status
--------------

This project is actively under development, and is being used in [Artsy's
new auction app](https://github.com/Artsy/eidolon). We consider it
ready for production use.

Installation
------------

### Moya version vs Swift version.

Because of the many Swift versions Moya supports, it might be confusing to
find the version of Moya that you need. Below is a table that shows which version of Moya
you should use for your Swift version.

| Swift version | Moya version  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 3.X           | >= 8.0.0      |
| 2.3           | 7.0.2 - 7.0.4 |
| 2.2           | <= 7.0.1      |

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate using Apple's Swift package manager, add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/Moya/Moya", majorVersion: 8)
```

and then specify `.Target(name: "Moya")` as a dependency of the Target in which you wish to use Moya.
Here's an example `PackageDescription`:

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
  name: "MyApp",
  dependencies: [
    .Package(url: "https://github.com/Moya/Moya", majorVersion: 8)
  ]
)
```

### CocoaPods

For Moya, use the following entry in your Podfile:

```rb
pod 'Moya'

# or 

pod 'Moya/RxSwift'

# or

pod 'Moya/ReactiveSwift'
```

Then run `pod install`.

In any file you'd like to use Moya in, don't forget to
import the framework with `import Moya`.

### Carthage

Carthage users can point to this repository and use whichever
generated framework they'd like, `Moya`, `RxMoya`, or `ReactiveMoya`.

```
github "Moya/Moya"
```

### Manually

- Open up Terminal, `cd` into your top-level project directory, and run the following command *if* your project is not initialized as a git repository:

```bash
$ git init
```

- Add Alamofire, Result & Moya as a git [submodule](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) by running the following commands:

```bash
$ git submodule add https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire.git
$ git submodule add https://github.com/antitypical/Result.git
$ git submodule add https://github.com/Moya/Moya.git
```

- Open the new `Alamofire` folder, and drag the `Alamofire.xcodeproj` into the Project Navigator of your application's Xcode project. Do the same with the `Result.xcodeproj` in the `Result` folder and `Moya.xcodeproj` in the `Moya` folder.

> They should appear nested underneath your application's blue project icon. Whether it is above or below all the other Xcode groups does not matter.

- Verify that the deployment targets of the `xcodeproj`s match that of your application target in the Project Navigator.
- Next, select your application project in the Project Navigator (blue project icon) to navigate to the target configuration window and select the application target under the "Targets" heading in the sidebar.
- In the tab bar at the top of that window, open the "General" panel.
- Click on the `+` button under the "Embedded Binaries" section.
- You will see two different `Alamofire.xcodeproj` folders each with two different versions of the `Alamofire.framework` nested inside a `Products` folder.

> It does not matter which `Products` folder you choose from, but it does matter whether you choose the top or bottom `Alamofire.framework`.

- Select the top `Alamofire.framework` for iOS and the bottom one for OS X.

> You can verify which one you selected by inspecting the build log for your project. The build target for `Alamofire` will be listed as either `Alamofire iOS`, `Alamofire macOS`, `Alamofire tvOS` or `Alamofire watchOS`.

- Click on the `+` button under "Embedded Binaries" again and add the build target you need for `Result`.
- Click on the `+` button again and add the correct build target for `Moya`.

- And that's it!

> The three frameworks are automagically added as a target dependency, linked framework and embedded framework in a copy files build phase which is all you need to build on the simulator and a device.

Usage
---

After [some setup](docs/Examples/Basic.md), using Moya is really simple. You can access an API like this:

```swift
provider = MoyaProvider<GitHub>()
provider.request(.zen) { result in
    switch result {
    case let .success(moyaResponse):
        let data = moyaResponse.data
        let statusCode = moyaResponse.statusCode
        // do something with the response data or statusCode
    case let .failure(error):
        // this means there was a network failure - either the request
        // wasn't sent (connectivity), or no response was received (server
        // timed out).  If the server responds with a 4xx or 5xx error, that
        // will be sent as a ".success"-ful response.
    }
}
```

That's a basic example. Many API requests need parameters. Moya encodes these
into the enum you use to access the endpoint, like this:

```swift
provider = MoyaProvider<GitHub>()
provider.request(.userProfile("ashfurrow")) { result in
    // do something with the result
}
```

No more typos in URLs. No more missing parameter values. No more messing with
parameter encoding.

For more examples, see the [documentation](docs/Examples).

Reactive Extensions
-------------------

Even cooler are the reactive extensions. Moya provides reactive extensions for
[ReactiveSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift) and
[RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift).

## ReactiveSwift

After `ReactiveSwift` [setup](docs/ReactiveSwift.md), `request(:)` method
immediately returns a `SignalProducer` (`RACSignal` is also available if needed)
that you can start or bind or map or whatever you want to do. To handle errors,
for instance, we could do the following:

```swift
provider = ReactiveSwiftMoyaProvider<GitHub>()
provider.request(.userProfile("ashfurrow")).start { event in
    switch event {
    case let .value(response):
        image = UIImage(data: response.data)
    case let .failed(error):
        print(error)
    default:
        break
    }
}
```

## RxSwift

After `RxSwift` [setup](docs/RxSwift.md), `request(:)` method immediately
returns an `Observable` that you can subscribe to or bind or map or whatever you
want to do. To handle errors, for instance, we could do the following:

```swift
provider = RxMoyaProvider<GitHub>()
provider.request(.userProfile("ashfurrow")).subscribe { event in
    switch event {
    case let .next(response):
        image = UIImage(data: response.data)
    case let .error(error):
        print(error)
    default:
        break
    }
}
```

---

In addition to the option of using signals instead of callback blocks, there are
also a series of signal operators for RxSwift and ReactiveSwift that will attempt
to map the data received from the network response into either an image, some JSON,
or a string, with `mapImage()`, `mapJSON()`, and `mapString()`, respectively. If the mapping is unsuccessful, you'll get an error on the signal. You also get handy methods
for filtering out certain status codes. This means that you can place your code for
handling API errors like 400's in the same places as code for handling invalid
responses.

By default, all of your requests will be put onto a background thread by `Alamofire`, and the 
response will be called on the main scheduler.
If you want your response called on a different thread, you can either initialize your `Provider` with a thread
```swift
provider = RxMoyaProvider<GitHub>(queue: DispatchQueue.global(.utility))
provider.request(.userProfile("ashfurrow"))
  .map { /* this is called on a utility thread */ }
```

or, you can choose to `.observeOn` the response on a specific scheduler:
```swift
provider = RxMoyaProvider<GitHub>()
provider.request(.userProfile("ashfurrow"))
  .map { /* this is called on the current thread */ }
  .observeOn(ConcurrentDispatchQueueScheduler(qos: .utility))
  .map { /* this is called on a utility thread */ }
```

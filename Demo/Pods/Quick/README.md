Quick is a behavior-driven development framework for Swift and Objective-C.
Inspired by [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec), [Specta](https://github.com/specta/specta), and [Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo).

```swift
// Swift

import Quick
import Nimble

class TableOfContentsSpec: QuickSpec {
  override func spec() {
    describe("the 'Documentation' directory") {
      it("has everything you need to get started") {
        let sections = Directory("Documentation").sections
        expect(sections).to(contain("Organized Tests with Quick Examples and Example Groups"))
        expect(sections).to(contain("Installing Quick"))
      }

      context("if it doesn't have what you're looking for") {
        it("needs to be updated") {
          let you = You(awesome: true)
          expect{you.submittedAnIssue}.toEventually(beTruthy())
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
#### Nimble
Quick comes together with [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble) â€” a matcher framework for your tests. You can learn why `XCTAssert()` statements make your expectations unclear and how to fix that using Nimble assertions [here](./Documentation/NimbleAssertions.md).

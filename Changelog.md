# [13.0.0-beta.1] - 2019-03-31

### Changed
- **Breaking Change** `.mapImage()` extension on `Single` and `Observable` now returns non-optional image. [#1789](https://github.com/Moya/Moya/pull/1789), [#1799](https://github.com/Moya/Moya/pull/1799) by [@bjarkehs](https://github.com/bjarkehs) and [@sunshinejr](https://github.com/sunshinejr).

- Updates Alamofire dependency to `~> 3.0`

# [3.0.1] - 2015-10-08
### Changed
- Changes `mapImage()` RxSwift function to use `UIImage!` instead of `UIImage`.

# [3.0.0] - 2015-10-05
### Changed
- Makes `parameters` on `MoyaTarget` an optional `[String: AnyObject]` dictionary.
- Makes `parameters` and `httpHeaderFields` on `Endpoint` to be optionals.
- Renamed stubbing identifiers: **Breaking Change**
  - `Moya.StubbedBehavior` renamed to `Moya.StubBehavior`
  - `Moya.MoyaStubbedBehavior` renamed to `Moya.StubClosure`
  - `Moya.NoStubbingBehavior` -> `Moya.NeverStub`
  - `Moya.ImmediateStubbingBehaviour` -> `Moya.ImmediatelyStub`
  - `Moya.DelayedStubbingBehaviour` -> `Moya.DelayedStub`
- Default class functions have been moved to extensions to prevent inadvertent subclassing.
- Renamed other identifiers: **Breaking Change**
  - `MoyaProvider.MoyaEndpointsClosure` to `MoyaProvider.EndpointClosure`
  - `MoyaProvider.MoyaEndpointResolution` to `MoyaProvider.RequestClosure`
  - `MoyaProvider.endpointResolver` to `MoyaProvider.requestClosure`
  - `MoyaProvider.stubBehavior` to `MoyaProvider.stubClosure`
  - `MoyaCredentialClosure` to `CredentialClosure`
  - `MoyaProvider` initializer parameter names
  - `MoyaCompletion` to `Moya.Completion`
  - `DefaultEndpointResolution` to `DefaultRequestMapping`
- Renamed `T` generic types of `MoyaProvider` and `Endpoint` classes to `Target`.
- Removed errantly named `DefaultEndpointResolution`
- Changes the closure to map `Endpoint`s to `NSURLRequest`s asynchonous.
- Removes inflight request tracking for ReactiveCocoa and RxSwift providers. **Breaking Change**
- Renamed `EndpointSampleResponse` cases: **Breaking Change**
  - `Success` to `NetworkResponse`, now contains `NSData` instead of `() -> NSData`.
  - `Error` to `NetworkError`
  - Additionally, `NetworkError` no longer has a status code or data associated with it. This represents an error from the underlying iOS network stack, like an inability to connect. See [#200](https://github.com/Moya/Moya/issues/200) for more details.
  - Also additionally, removed `Closure` case (see below).
- Changed `Endpoint` to use a `sampleResponseClosure` instead of a `sampleResponse`, making all sample responses lazily executed. **Breaking Change**
- New plugin architecture **Breaking Change**
  - This replaces `networkActivityClosure` with a plugin.
- ReactiveCocoa provider no longer replaces errors that contain status codes (an unlikely situation) with its own errors. It passes all errors directly through.
- Renames `token` to `target` (it was usually `target` anyway, just made it consistent).

### Added
- Adds support for ReactiveCocoa 4 by moving `ReactiveCocoaMoyaProvider` to use `SignalProducer` instead of `RACSignal`

### Fixed
- Corrects problem with ignoring the specified Alamofire manager

# [2.4.0] - 2015-09-22
### Added
- Adds HTTP basic auth support.

# [2.3.0] - 2015-09-22
### Added
- Adds data processing functions for use with `RxMoyaProvider`

# [2.2.2] - 2015-09-16

# [2.2.0] - 2015-09-14
### Added
- Add backward-compatible call from `DefaultEnpointResolution` to `DefaultEndpointResolution` on `MoyaProvider` class. `DefaultEndpointResolution` is now used internally as the default resolver. `DefaultEnpointResolution` can be removed in a future major release.
- Carthage support.

# [2.1.0] - 2015-08-11
### Added
- Add option to pass an `Alamofire.Manager` to `MoyaProvider` initializer

# [2.0.2] - 2015-08-11
### Changed
- Updates Demo directory's RxSwift version.

# [2.0.1] - 2015-08-06
### Changed

# [2.0.0] - 2015-08-04
### Changed
- **Breaking change** Combines `MoyaPath` and `MoyaTarget` protocols.
- **Breaking change** Renames `Moya/Reactive` subspec to `Moya/ReactiveCocoa`.
- **Breaking change** Removes `stubResponses` from initializer; replaced with new stubbing behavior `.NoStubbing`. Added class methods to `MoyaProvider` to provide defaults, while allowing users to still change stubbing behavior on a per-request basis.
- **Breaking change** Redefines types of `DefaultEndpointMapping` and `DefaultEnpointResolution` class functions on `MoyaProvider`. You no longer invoke these functions to return a closure, rather, you reference the functions themselves _as_ closures.
- **Breaking change** Renames `endpointsClosure` parameter and property of `MoyaProvider` to `endpointClosure`.
- **Breaking change** Renames `ReactiveMoyaProvider` to `ReactiveCocoaMoyaProvider` for consistency.
- Relaxes version dependency on RxSwift - [@alcarvalho](http://github.com/alcarvalho)

### Added
- Adds official Carthage support – [@neonichu](http://github.com/neonichu)

### Fixed
- Fixes problem that the `ReactiveMoyaProvider` initializer would not respect the stubbing behavior it was passed.
- Fixes possible concurrency bugs with reactive providers - [@alcarvalho](http://github.com/alcarvalho)

# [1.1.1] - 2015-06-12
### Fixed
- Fixes problem where `RxMoyaProvider` would not respect customized stubbing behavior (delays).

# [1.1.0] - 2015-06-08
### Added
- Adds support for RxSwift – [@alcarvalho](http://github.com/alcarvalho)

# [1.0.0] - 2015-05-27
### Changed
- **Breaking change** Changes `EndpointSampleResponse` to require closures that return `NSData`, not `NSData` instances themselves. This prevents sample data from being loaded during the normal, non-unit test app lifecycle.
- **Breaking change** Adds `method` to `MoyaTarget` protocol and removes `method` parameter from `request()` functions. Targets now specify GET, POST, etc on a per-target level, instead of per-request.
- **Breaking change** Adds `parameters` to `MoyaTarget` protocol and removes ability to pass parameters into `request()` functions. Targets now specify the parameters directly on a per-target level, instead of per-request.
- Adds a sane default implementation of the `MoyaProvider` initializer's `endpointsClosure` parameter.

# [0.8.0] - 2015-05-25
### Changed

# [0.7.0] - 2015-04-27
### Added
- Adds network activity closure to provider.

# [0.6.1] - 2017-01-13
### Changed
- Updates podspec to refer to `3.0.0-aplha.1` of ReactiveCocoa. -[@ashfurrow](http://github.com/ashfurrow)

# [0.6] - 2015-01-11
### Added
- First release on CocoaPods trunk.
- Add data support for [stubbed error responses](https://github.com/ashfurrow/Moya/pull/92). – [@steam](http://github.com.steam)

### Fixed
- Fixes [#66](https://github.com/AshFurrow/Moya/issues/66), a problem with outdated Alamofire dependency and it's serializer type signature. -[@garnett](http://github.com/garnett)

### Changed
- Delete note about ReactiveCocoa installation -[@garnett](http://github.com/garnett)

# [0.5] - 2014-10-09
### Fixed
- Fixes [#52](https://github.com/AshFurrow/Moya/issues/52) to change submodules to use http instead of ssh. -[@ashfurrow)](http://github.com/AshFurrow)
- Fixes [#63](https://github.com/AshFurrow/Moya/issues/63), a problem where stale inflight requests were kept around if they error'd down the pipline (discussed [here](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/issues/1525#issuecomment-58559734)) -[@ashfurrow](http://github.com/AshFurrow)

### Added
- Adds the original NSURLResponse to a MoyaResponse -[@orta)](http://github.com/orta)

### Changed
- Migrate to support Xcode beta 6.1 -[@orta)](http://github.com/orta)


# [0.4] -2014-09-22
### Added
- Implements [#46](https://github.com/AshFurrow/Moya/issues/46), the code property of the NSError sent through by ReactiveMoyaProvider will now match the failing http status code. -[@powerje](http://github.com/powerje)

# [0.3] - 2014-09-12
### Fixed
- Fixes [#48](https://github.com/AshFurrow/Moya/issues/48) that modifies Moya to execute completion blocks of stubbed responses *immediately*, instead of using `dispatch_async` to defer it to the next invocation of the run loop. **This is a breaking change**. Because of this change, the ReactiveCocoa extensions had to be modified slightly to deduplicate inflight stubbed requests. Reactive providers now vend `RACSignal` instances that start the network request *when subscribed to*. -[@ashfurrow](http://github.com/AshFurrow)

# [0.2] - 2014-09-15
### Fixed
- Fixes [#44](https://github.com/AshFurrow/Moya/issues/44) where status codes weren't being passed through to completion blocks. This also modified the behavior of the ReactiveCocoa extensions significantly but sending MoyaResponse objects instead of just NSData ones. —[@ashfurrow](http://github.com/AshFurrow)

# [0.1] - 2014-09-07

- Initial release.

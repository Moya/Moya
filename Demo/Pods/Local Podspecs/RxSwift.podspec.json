  "description": "This is a Swift port of Reactive extensions.\n\n[https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions)\n\nLike the original Rx, its intention is to enable easy composition of asynchronous operations and event streams.\n\nIt tries to port as many concepts from the original Rx as possible, but some concepts were adapted for more pleasant and performant integration with iOS/OSX environment.\n\nProbably the best analogy for those who have never heard of Rx would be:\n\n\n```\ngit diff | grep bug | less          #  linux pipes - programs communicate by sending\n\t\t\t\t    #  sequences of bytes, words, lines, '\u0000' terminated strings...\n```\nwould become if written in RxSwift\n```\ngitDiff() >- grep(\"bug\") >- less    // rx sink (>-) operator - rx units communicate by sending\n\t\t\t\t    // sequences of swift objects\n```",

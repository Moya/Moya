# Endpoints

An endpoint is a semi-internal data structure that Moya uses to reason about
the network request that will ultimately be made. An endpoint stores the
following data:

- The url.
- The HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, etc).
- The HTTP request header fields.
- `Task` to differentiate `upload`, `download` or `request`.
- The sample response (for unit testing).

[Providers](Providers.md) map [Targets](Targets.md) to Endpoints, then map
Endpoints to actual network requests.

There are two ways that you interact with Endpoints.

1. When creating a provider, you may specify a mapping from `Target` to `Endpoint`.
1. When creating a provider, you may specify a mapping from `Endpoint` to `URLRequest`.

The first might resemble the following:

```swift
let endpointClosure = { (target: MyTarget) -> Endpoint<MyTarget> in
    let url = URL(target: target).absoluteString
    return Endpoint(url: url, sampleResponseClosure: {.networkResponse(200, target.sampleData)}, method: target.method, task: target.task, httpHeaderFields: target.headers)
}
```

This is actually the default implementation Moya provides. If you need something
custom, or if you're creating a test provider that returns non-200 HTTP statuses in unit tests,
this is where you would do it.

Notice the `URL(target:)` initializer, Moya provides a convenient extension to create a `URL` from any `TargetType`.

The second use is very uncommon. Moya tries to prevent you from having to worry
about low-level details. But it's there if you need it. Its use is covered
further below.

Let's take a look at an example of the flexibility mapping from a Target to
an Endpoint can provide.

## From Target to Endpoint

In this closure you have absolute power over converting from `Target` to `Endpoint`.
You can change the `task`, `method`, `url`, `headers` or `sampleResponse`.
For example, we may wish to set our application name in the HTTP header fields for server-side
analytics.

```swift
let endpointClosure = { (target: MyTarget) -> Endpoint<MyTarget> in
    let defaultEndpoint = MoyaProvider.defaultEndpointMapping(for: target)
    return defaultEndpoint.adding(newHTTPHeaderFields: ["APP_NAME": "MY_AWESOME_APP"])
}
let provider = MoyaProvider<GitHub>(endpointClosure: endpointClosure)
```

*Note that header fields can also be added as part of the [Target](Targets.md) definition.*

This also means that you can provide additional parameters to some or all of
your endpoints. For example, say that there is an authentication token we need
for all values of the hypothetical `MyTarget` target, with the exception of the
target that actually does the authentication. We could construct an
`endpointClosure` resembling the following.

```swift
let endpointClosure = { (target: MyTarget) -> Endpoint<MyTarget> in
    let defaultEndpoint = MoyaProvider.defaultEndpointMapping(for: target)

    // Sign all non-authenticating requests
    switch target {
    case .authenticate:
        return defaultEndpoint
    default:
        return defaultEndpoint.adding(newHTTPHeaderFields: ["AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN": GlobalAppStorage.authToken])
    }
}
let provider = MoyaProvider<GitHub>(endpointClosure: endpointClosure)
```

Awesome.

Note that we can rely on the existing behavior of Moya and extend – instead
of replace – it. The `adding(newHttpHeaderFields:)` function allows you to
rely on the existing Moya code and add your own custom values.

Sample responses are a requirement of the `TargetType` protocol. However, they
only specify the data returned. The Target-to-Endpoint mapping closure is where
you can specify more details, which is useful for unit testing.

Sample responses have one of these values:

- `.networkError(NSError)` when network failed to send the request, or failed to retrieve a response (eg a timeout).
- `.networkResponse(Int, Data)` where `Int` is a status code and `Data` is the returned data.
- `.response(HTTPURLResponse, Data)` where `HTTPURLResponse` is the response and `Data` is the returned data. This one can be used to fully stub a response.


## Request Mapping

As we mentioned earlier, the purpose of this library is not really to provide a
coding framework with which to access the network – that's Alamofire's job.
Instead, Moya is about a way to frame your thoughts about network access and
provide compile-time checking of well-defined network targets. You've already
seen how to map targets into endpoints using the `endpointClosure` parameter
of the `MoyaProvider` initializer. That lets you create an `Endpoint` instance
that Moya will use to reason about the network API call. At some point, that
`Endpoint` must be resolved into an actual `URLRequest` to give to Alamofire.
That's what the `requestClosure` parameter is for.

The `requestClosure` is an optional, last-minute way to modify the request
that hits the network. It has a default value of `MoyaProvider.defaultRequestMapping`,
which uses the `urlRequest()` method of the `Endpoint` instance. This `urlRequest()` 
method throws three possible errors: 
- `MoyaError.requestMapping(String)` when `URLRequest` could not be created for given path
- `MoyaError.parameterEncoding(Swift.Error)` when parameters couldn't be encoded
- `MoyaError.encodableMapping(Swift.Error)` when `Encodable` object couldn't be encoded into `Data`

This closure receives an `Endpoint` instance and is responsible for invoking a
its argument of `RequestResultClosure` (shorthand for `Result<URLRequest, MoyaError> -> Void`) with a request that represents the Endpoint.
It's here that you'd do your OAuth signing or whatever. Since you may invoke the
closure asynchronously, you can use whatever authentication library you like ([example](https://github.com/rheinfabrik/Heimdallr.swift)).
Instead of modifying the request, you could simply log it, instead.

```swift
let requestClosure = { (endpoint: Endpoint<GitHub>, done: MoyaProvider.RequestResultClosure) in
    do {
        var request = try endpoint.urlRequest()
        // Modify the request however you like.
        done(.success(request))
    } catch {
	done(.failure(MoyaError.underlying(error)))
    }

}
let provider = MoyaProvider<GitHub>(requestClosure: requestClosure)
```

This `requestClosure` is useful for modifying properties specific to the `URLRequest` or providing information to the request that cannot be known until that request is created, like cookies settings. Note that the `endpointClosure` mentioned above is not intended for this purpose or any request-specific application-level mapping.

This parameter is actually very useful for modifying the request object.
`URLRequest` has many properties you can customize. Say you want to disable
all cookies on requests:

```swift
{ (endpoint: Endpoint<ArtsyAPI>, done: MoyaProvider.RequestResultClosure) in
    do {
    	var request: URLRequest = try endpoint.urlRequest
    	request.httpShouldHandleCookies = false
   	done(.success(request))
    } catch {
    	done(.failure(MoyaError.underlying(error)))
    }
}
```

You could also perform logging of network requests, since this closure is
invoked just before the request is sent to the network.

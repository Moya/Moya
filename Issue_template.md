<!-- Please wrap code blocks in backticks, like so:
```swift
*your code goes here*
```

The code will automatically get its syntax highlighted, and doesn't need to be indented 4 spaces to be shown as code.

When referencing a dependancy manager-related issue (think CocoaPods, Carthage, SwiftPM), please add its configuration file to the issue.
It would be helpful to put the contents in a code block too, using ```ruby for CocoaPods and ```swift for SwiftPM.

Also please make sure your title describes your problem well. Questions end with a question mark.

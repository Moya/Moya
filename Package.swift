// swift-tools-version:5.0
// This Package.swift is split for production use and development separately.
// Basically SPM fetches testing dependencies even though they are not needed for the main target. And because
// of that, sometimes the build fails as the build system wants to build XCTest or other frameworks for main bundle...
// TL;DR waiting for SE-0226 to be implemented: https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0226-package-manager-target-based-dep-resolution.md
//
// In the meantime:
//     - when you include our library as a dependency SPM won't fetch testing libraries
//     - when you want to test the library use `TEST=1 swift test` and it should work properly
